<h4><u>IMPORTANT NOTE</u></h4>
SCP-warden is an elusive, reckless crazy scientist that's 
    capable of jumping through <br>the infinite multiverse. 
    his nihilistic world views are sources of concern <br>
    for the safety of human society. subjectâ€™s goal 
    is unknown and his <br>mysterious origins are still 
    in large sources of speculation.<br> Reports suggested that subject 
    has destroyed multiple universe<br> and is classified as a world-ending
    threat which requires massive effort <br>from the foundation
    to deal with. <hr>
